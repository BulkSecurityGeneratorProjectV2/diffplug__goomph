Please make sure that your [PR allows edits from maintainers](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/).  Sometimes its faster for us to just fix something than it is to describe how to fix it.

After creating the PR, please add a commit that adds a bullet-point under the `-SNAPSHOT` section of [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/diffplug/goomph/blob/master/CHANGES.md) that includes:

- [ ] a summary of the change
- [ ] a link to the newly created PR

This makes it easier for the maintainers to quickly release your changes.
